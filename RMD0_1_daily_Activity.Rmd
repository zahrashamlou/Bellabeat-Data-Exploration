## Introduction

This case study analyzes user activity data from Bellabeat, a high-tech health product company for women.
The goal is to understand user behavior patterns by exploring activity, sleep, and calorie data, and to identify actionable insights for product improvement.


## Data Loading and Preparation
We load and combine two datasets from different collections, then clean and summarize the data.


```{r }
# Load datasets
dailyActivity_merged1 <- read_csv("C:/Users/zsham/OneDrive/google_data_analysis_bellabeat/data/First_Collection/dailyActivity_merged.csv")
dailyActivity_merged2 <- read_csv("C:/Users/zsham/OneDrive/google_data_analysis_bellabeat/data/Second_Collection/dailyActivity_merged.csv")

# Combine datasets
dailyActivity_merged <- rbind(dailyActivity_merged1, dailyActivity_merged2)
rm(dailyActivity_merged1, dailyActivity_merged2)

# Check for duplicate rows by Id and ActivityDate
duplicates <- dailyActivity_merged %>%
  group_by(Id, ActivityDate) %>%
  filter(n() > 1)

# Aggregate numeric columns by Id and ActivityDate
dailyActivity_merged <- dailyActivity_merged %>%
  group_by(Id, ActivityDate) %>%
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), sum, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Format dates and create weekday column
dailyActivity_merged <- dailyActivity_merged %>%
  mutate(
    ActivityDate = as.Date(ActivityDate, format = "%m/%d/%Y"),
    Weekday = weekdays(ActivityDate)
  )
```



## Data Quality Checks

```{r }
# Check for any duplicate rows overall
any_duplicated <- any(duplicated(dailyActivity_merged))

# Missing value summary
missing_values <- colSums(is.na(dailyActivity_merged))

```

## Feature Engineering
We create new features for active distance and active minutes by summing relevant columns.
```{r }
dailyActivity_merged <- dailyActivity_merged %>%
  mutate(
    total_active_dis = VeryActiveDistance + ModeratelyActiveDistance + LightActiveDistance,
    total_active_min = VeryActiveMinutes + FairlyActiveMinutes + LightlyActiveMinutes
  )

```




## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)



### Distribution of Key Variables

```{r }
ggplot(dailyActivity_merged, aes(x = TotalSteps)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000, color = "white", fill = "skyblue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Total Steps")

ggplot(dailyActivity_merged, aes(x = Calories)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 200, color = "white", fill = "skyblue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Calories Burned")

ggplot(dailyActivity_merged, aes(x = total_active_dis)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = "orange") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Total Active Distance")

ggplot(dailyActivity_merged, aes(x = total_active_min)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = "orange") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Total Active Minutes")

```


### Activity by User and Weekday

```{r }
dailyActivity_merged %>%
  group_by(Id, Weekday) %>%
  summarise(total_active_dis = sum(total_active_dis), .groups = "drop") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(Id), y = total_active_dis, fill = Weekday)) +
  geom_col(position = "stack", width = 0.7) +
  labs(x = "User ID", y = "Total Active Distance (km)", title = "Stacked Total Active Distance by User and Weekday") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())

```


### Time Series of Activity

Mean Active Distance with Standard Error Bars

```{r }
summary_df <- dailyActivity_merged %>%
  group_by(ActivityDate) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_active_dis = mean(total_active_dis),
    se_active_dis = sd(total_active_dis) / sqrt(n()),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

ggplot(summary_df, aes(x = ActivityDate, y = mean_active_dis)) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean_active_dis - se_active_dis, ymax = mean_active_dis + se_active_dis), width = 0.2, color = "gray30", alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(title = "Time Series of Mean Active Distance with Standard Error Bars", x = "Date", y = "Mean Active Distance (km)") +
  theme_minimal()

```


## Behavioral Trends by Weekday
Average Steps, Distance, and Calories with 95% Confidence Intervals

```{r }
plot_weekday_trend <- function(data, var, y_label, title, line_color) {
  data %>%
    mutate(Weekday = factor(Weekday, levels = c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))) %>%
    group_by(Weekday) %>%
    summarise(
      avg = mean({{var}}, na.rm = TRUE),
      se = sd({{var}}, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(n()),
      .groups = "drop"
    ) %>%
    mutate(
      ci_low = avg - 1.96 * se,
      ci_high = avg + 1.96 * se
    ) %>%

```
## Cumulative Steps per User Over Time
